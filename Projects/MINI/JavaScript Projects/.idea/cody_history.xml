Focus on providing up to 5 constructive suggestions that could make the code more robust, efficient, or align with best practices. For each suggestion, provide a brief explanation of the potential benefits. After listing any recommendations, summarize if you found notable opportunities to enhance the code quality overall or if the code generally follows sound design principles. If no issues found, reply 'There are no errors.'" />

                      <text value="Here are a few suggestions to improve the code:&#10;&#10;1. **Use a more descriptive variable name for `row`**: The variable name `row` is not very descriptive, and it's not immediately clear what it represents. Consider using a more descriptive name like `numImages` or `imagesToDisplay`.&#10;&#10;2. **Separate concerns by extracting the image rendering logic into a separate function**: The code that creates and appends the `img` elements to the DOM is mixed with the logic for getting a random image URL. It would be better to separate these concerns by extracting the image rendering logic into a separate function, making the code more modular and easier to maintain.&#10;&#10;3. **Consider using a Set instead of an Array for `imageURLS`**: Since the code removes the selected image URL from the `imageURLS` array after each iteration, using a Set instead of an Array could potentially improve performance, as removing an element from a Set is generally faster than removing it from an Array.&#10;&#10;4. **Add error handling for failed image loads**: The code currently does not handle cases where an image fails to load. It would be a good idea to add an `onerror` event handler to the `img` elements to handle failed image loads gracefully, either by displaying a default image or providing a user-friendly error message.&#10;&#10;5. **Consider lazy-loading images**: If the number of images to be displayed is large, it might be beneficial to implement lazy-loading, where images are only loaded when they are about to become visible in the viewport. This can improve the initial page load time and overall performance, especially on slower network connections.&#10;&#10;Overall, while the code is functional and follows some good practices (e.g., using `const` and `let` for variable declarations), there are opportunities to improve its readability, maintainability, and performance. By addressing the suggestions above, the code could become more robust, efficient, and easier to work with in the long run." />
