## What I learned?

I learned the following topics:

- use of Static keyword in javascript
- bind keyword in javascript

## What I developed/solved?

- Solved one leetcode problem called Two sum

## Code snippet/Screenshots/notes

1. Leetcode problem 1. Two sum
- Problem statement: Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.
- Example.

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
```

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

- Brute force approach

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int size = nums.size();
        vector<int> ans;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            int flag = 0;
            for (int j = i+1; j < size; j++) {
            /* when the summation of these two becomes equal or up to target
               return the indexes of both
            */
                int sum = nums[j] + nums[i];
                if (sum == target && i != j){
                   ans.push_back(i);
                   ans.push_back(j);
                   /* flag used to determine that we have found 
                   that element whose summmation is equal to target
                    */
                   flag = 1;
                }
            }
            //flag = 1 meaning we got our answer so no need to go further
            if(flag == 1){
                break;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
// Time complexity: O(n)*O(n)=O(n^2)
// Space comlexity: O(1) as we aren't using extra space
```

- optimal approach using hashmap

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        map<int, int> m;
        vector<int> v;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int first = nums[i];
            int second = target - first;

            if (m.find(second) != m.end()) {
                v.push_back(m[second]);
                v.push_back(i);
            }

            m[first] = i;
        }

        return v;
    }
};
/* Time complexity: O(N * logN), where n = number of elements in an array
logN = time takes for insertion in map
   Space complexity: O(N)
*/ 
```

## Static keyword in JavaScript

- `static` keyword is used to define a static method for a class.
- `static` methods aren't called on instances of the class. Instead, they're called on the class itself.
- You call it on the class, but on the instances of class

## Bind keyword

- `bind()` method in JavaScript is a method that allows you to set the `this` value in a function.
